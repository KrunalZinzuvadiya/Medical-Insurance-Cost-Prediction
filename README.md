# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient demographic and health data, the project builds a regression model to estimate costs accurately. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using linear regression.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Gain insights into medical insurance cost trends using EDA and visualizations.
- **Regression Model:** Predict insurance costs using a trained Linear Regression model.
- **Interactive Workflow:** Includes data loading, cleaning, and modeling steps for reproducibility.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
